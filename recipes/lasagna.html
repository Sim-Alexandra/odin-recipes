    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna , also known by the plural form lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. In Italian cuisine it is made of stacked layers of pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices.The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking.
           Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (al forno). The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin oil</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
                <li>1/2 medium onion , diced(about 3/4 cup)</li>
                <li>1/2 large bell pepper</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic , minced</li>
                <li>1 can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
                <li>3 ounces tomato paste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
            </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the pasta water on to boil:</li>
                    <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>
                <li>Brown the ground beef:</li>
                    <p>In a large skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</p>
                <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic; Add back the beef:</li>
                    <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo, we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).
                    Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
                    Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
                <li>Make the sauce:</li>
                    <p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.
                    Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.</p>
                <li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</li>
                    <p>By now, the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions. (Note: noodles may be cooked in advance.)</p>
                <li>Assemble the lasagna:</li>
                    <p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce over the bottom of the dish and spread it evenly. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise over the sauce (about 3 long noodles; the edges may overlap, depending on your pan). Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.</p>
                <li>Bake:</li>
                    <p>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tenting the foil slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce. Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. If you'd like more of a crusty top or edges, uncover the lasagna in the last 10 minutes.</p>
                <li>Cool and serve:</li>
                    <p>Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. You can reheat lasagna in a conventional oven or microwave. While storing, leave the aluminum tent on. (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)</p>
            </ol>

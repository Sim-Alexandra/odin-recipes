   <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A crêpe or crepe is a dish made from unleavened batter or dough that is cooked on a frying pan or a griddle. Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: sweet crêpes (crêpes sucrées) or savoury galettes (crêpes salées). 
    They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as cheese, fruit, vegetables, meats, and a variety of spreads.
    Crêpes can also be flambéed, such as in crêpes Suzette.</p>
        <p>Sweet crêpes are generally made with wheat flour (farine de blé). When sweet, they can be eaten as part of breakfast or as a dessert.
     Common fillings include hazelnut cocoa spread, preserves, sugar (granulated or powdered), maple syrup, golden syrup, lemon juice, whipped cream, fruit spreads, custard, and sliced soft fruits or confiture.</p>

     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Whole milk & water</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter:</li>
                <p>Melt some butter in the microwave or on the stove. Let it cool for a few minutes before using in the batter. (Otherwise you could scramble the eggs.)</p>
            <li>Combine all ingrediemts in a blender:</li>
                <p>Add the cooled melted butter and all the remaining ingredients into a blender. A blender works WONDERFULLY to smooth out the batter because it cuts that flour perfectly into all the wet ingredients. If you don't have a blender, just use a mixing bowl and whisk.</p>
            <li>Chill the batter:</li>
                <p>Chill the crepe batter for at least 30–60 minutes before cooking it. This time in the refrigerator is crucial to the taste, texture, and success of your crepes. Use this time to clean up and get your skillet ready. You can even chill the batter overnight so it’s ready to cook the next day.</p>
            <li>Butter & heat a small skillet</li>
                <p>Generously butter the pan and keep butter nearby for greasing the pan between each crepe, too. Though professional chefs may use a specialty crepe pan, I find a small 8-inch skillet works perfectly at home. If you don’t have a small skillet, use a larger one, but make sure you keep the crepes THIN.</p>
            <li>Cook crepes one at a time:</li>
                <p>he longest part of this recipe is standing over the stove and cooking them one at a time over medium heat. Use only 3–4 Tablespoons of batter per crepe. (I usually use 3 Tablespoons.) The less you use and the larger you stretch the crepe, the thinner they’ll be.</p>
            <li>Serve with favourite filling:</li>
                 <p>I love serving them warm with cold whipped cream and fresh berries. Keep scrolling because I have lots of filling ideas listed for you below.</p>

    <h1>Peanut Butter Noodles Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This nutty midnight pasta is a dream to cook, as it requires just a handful of pantry staples and one pot. Peanut butter (the less fancy, the better) anchors a creamy sauce swathed in umami. Accentuated by a good, salty Parmesan, these noodles recall those cheesy peanut butter sandwich crackers.
            They make an ideal dinner for one, but the amounts can easily be doubled or quadrupled as needed. For an equally gripping vegan alternative, try swapping out the butter for olive oil and the cheese for nutritional yeast.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>16 ounces brown rice noodles</li>
                <li>garlic</li>
                <li>ginger</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
                <li>creamy peanut butter</li>
                <li>soy sauce</li>
                <li>rice vinegar</li>
                <li>toasted sesame oil</li>
                <li>srisacha</li>
                <li>honey</li>
            </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook noodles:</li>
                    <p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook noodles according to package instructions.</p>
                <li>Saute garlic:</li>
                    <p>To start making the sauce, youâ€™ll want to finely mince the garlic and add to a saute pan with 1 tbsp of oil. Any oil will work here, I used olive. Coconut, avocado, etc. all work well too.</p>
                <li>Add all sauce ingredients:</li>
                    <p>Add in all remaining sauce ingredients and whisk together until smooth. </p>
                <li>Combine with noodles:</li>
                    <p>Add about 1/2 of the sauce to cooked pasta and mix together. I intentionally made extra sauce in case you want to add some chicken, tofu, veggies etc.</p>
                <li>Serve:</li>
                    <p>Serve exactly as is or top it off with chopped cilantro, red pepper flakes, scallions or crushed peanuts for some crunch.</p>
            </ol>
